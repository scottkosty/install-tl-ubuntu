\section{General Appearance}	

Contributions to {\it International Journal of Modern Physics D}
are to be in American English. Authors are encouraged to have their
contribution checked for grammar. American spelling should be
used. Abbreviations are allowed but should be spelt out in full when
first used. Integers ten and below are to be spelt out.  Italicize
foreign language phrases (e.g.~Latin, French).  Upon acceptance,
authors are required to submit their data source file including
postscript files for figures.

The text is to be typeset in 10 pt roman, single spaced with
baselineskip of 13~pt. Text area (including copyright block)
is 8 inches high and 5 inches wide for the first page.  Text area
(excluding running title) is 7.7 inches high and 5 inches wide for
subsequent pages.  Final pagination and insertion of running titles
will be done by the publisher.

\section{Running Heads}

Please provide a shortened runninghead (not more than eight words) for
the title of your paper. This will appear on the top right-hand side
of your paper.

\section{Major Headings}

Major headings should be typeset in boldface with the first
letter of important words capitalized.

\subsection{Sub-headings}

Sub-headings should be typeset in boldface italic and capitalize
the first letter of the first word only. Section number to be in
boldface roman.

\subsubsection{Sub-subheadings}

Typeset sub-subheadings in medium face italic and capitalize the
first letter of the first word only. Section numbers to be in
roman.

\subsection{Numbering and spacing}

Sections, sub-sections and sub-subsections are numbered in
Arabic.  Use double spacing before all section headings, and
single spacing after section headings. Flush left all paragraphs
that follow after section headings.

\subsection{Lists of items}

Lists may be laid out with each item marked by a dot:
\begin{itemlist}
 \item item one,
 \item item two.
\end{itemlist}
Items may also be numbered in lowercase roman numerals:
\begin{romanlist}[(ii)]
\item item one,
\item item two.
\begin{romanlist}[(b)]
\item Lists within lists can be numbered with lowercase roman letters,
\item second item.
\end{romanlist}
\end{romanlist}

\section{Equations}

Displayed equations should be numbered consecutively in each section,
with the number set flush right and enclosed in parentheses
\begin{equation}
\mu(n, t) = \frac{\sum^\infty_{i=1} 1(d_i < t, N(d_i)
= n)}{\int^t_{\sigma=0} 1(N(\sigma) = n)d\sigma}\,.
\label{eqn1}
\end{equation}

Equations should be referred to in abbreviated form,
e.g.~``Eq.~(\ref{eqn1})'' or ``(2)''. In multiple-line
equations, the number should be given on the last line.

\begin{figure}[pb]
\centerline{\psfig{file=ijmpdf1.eps,width=4.7cm}}
\vspace*{8pt}
\caption{A schematic illustration of dissociative recombination. The
direct mechanism, 4m$^2_\pi$ is initiated when the
molecular ion S$_{\rm L}$ captures an electron with
kinetic energy. \label{f1}}
\end{figure}

Displayed equations are to be centered on the page width.
Standard English letters like x are to appear as $x$
(italicized) in the text if they are used as mathematical
symbols. Punctuation marks are used at the end of equations as
if they appeared directly in the text.

\section{Theorem Environments}

\begin{theorem}
Theorems$,$ lemmas$,$ propositions$,$ corollaries are to be numbered
consecutively in the paper or in each section. Use italic for the
body and upper and lower case boldface$,$ for the declaration.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
Remarks, examples, definitions are to be numbered
consecutively in the paper or in each section. Use roman for the
body and upper and lower case boldface$,$ for the declaration.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
The word `Proof' should be type in boldface. Proofs
should end with\break
a box.
\end{proof}

\section{Illustrations and Photographs}

Figures are to be inserted in the text nearest their first
reference.  Original india ink drawings of glossy prints are
preferred. Please send one set of originals with copies. If the
author requires the publisher to reduce the figures, ensure that
the figures (including letterings and numbers) are large enough
to be clearly seen after reduction. If photographs are to be
used, only black and white ones are acceptable.

Figures are to be placed either top or bottom and sequentially
numbered in Arabic numerals. The caption must be placed below the
figure (see Fig.~\ref{f1}). Typeset in 8 pt roman with baselineskip of
10~pt. Use double spacing between a caption and the text that follows
immediately.

Previously published material must be accompanied by written
permission from the author and publisher.

\section{Tables}

Tables should be inserted in the text as close to the point of
reference as possible. Some space should be left above and below
the table.

Tables should be numbered sequentially in the text in Arabic
numerals. Captions are to be centralized above the tables (see
Table~\ref{ta1}).  Typeset tables and captions in 8 pt roman with
baselineskip of 10 pt.

\begin{table}[ph]
\tbl{Comparison of acoustic for frequencies for piston-cylinder problem.}
{\begin{tabular}{@{}cccc@{}} \toprule
Piston mass & Analytical frequency & TRIA6-$S_1$ model &
\% Error \\
& (Rad/s) & (Rad/s) \\ \colrule
1.0\hphantom{00} & \hphantom{0}281.0 & \hphantom{0}280.81 & 0.07 \\
0.1\hphantom{00} & \hphantom{0}876.0 & \hphantom{0}875.74 & 0.03 \\
0.01\hphantom{0} & 2441.0 & 2441.0\hphantom{0} & 0.0\hphantom{0} \\
0.001 & 4130.0 & 4129.3\hphantom{0} & 0.16\\ \botrule
\end{tabular} \label{ta1}}
\end{table}

If tables need to extend over to a second page, the continuation of
the table should be preceded by a caption, e.g.~``{\it Table 2.}
$(${\it Continued}$)$''.

\section{Footnotes}

Footnotes should be numbered sequentially in superscript lowercase
roman letters.\footnote{Footnotes should be typeset in 8~pt Times
roman at the bottom of the page.}

\section*{Acknowledgments}

This section should come before the References. Dedications and funding
information may also be included
here.

\appendix

\section{Appendices}

Appendices should be used only when absolutely necessary. They
should come\break
before the References. If there is more than one
appendix, number them alphabetically. Number displayed equations
occurring in the Appendix in this way, e.g.~(\ref{app1}),\break
(\ref{app2}), etc.
\begin{eqnarray}	%A.1
\begin{array}{rcl}
g_{\mu_1\mu_2} &=& g_{axby}=-\displaystyle{\epsilon_{abc}}{4\pi}\,
\frac{(x-y)^c}{|x-y|^3}\,, \\[8pt]
h_{\mu_1\mu_2\mu_3} &=& \epsilon^{\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_3}
g_{\mu_1\alpha_1}g_{\mu_2\alpha_2}g_{\mu_3\alpha_3}
\end{array}
\label{app1}
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}	%A.2
\epsilon^{\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_3} = \epsilon^{b_1y_1b_2y_2cx} =
\epsilon^{b_1b_2c}\delta(x-y_1)\delta(x-y_2)\,.
\label{app2}
\end{eqnarray}

If the atom remains in the cavity for a time $1/2\nu_R$, then it will
contribute a photon by stimulated emission.
Furthermore, the atom and photon field will exhibit a phase shift due
to the zero point energy of the quantum gravity vacuum.

\section{References}

References are to be listed in the order cited in the text in Arabic
numerals.  They should be listed according to the style shown in the
References. Typeset references in 9 pt roman.

References in the text can be typed in superscripts,
e.g.: ``$\ldots$ have proven\cite{edbk,rvo,seri} that
this equation $\ldots$'' or after punctuation marks:
``$\ldots$ in the statement.\cite{seri}'' This is
done using LaTeX command: ``\verb|\cite{name}|''.

When the reference forms part of the sentence, it should not
be typed in superscripts, e.g.: ``One can show from
Ref.~\refcite{edbk} that $\ldots$'', ``See
Refs.~\citen{jpap,colla,edbk}, \citen{seri}
and \citen{publ} for more details.''
This is done using the LaTeX
command: ``\verb|Ref.~\refcite{name}|''.
